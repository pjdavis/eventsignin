# Hack Huntsville sign-in app.

### Looking to have a sign-in app that keeps track of people coming to hack nights at hack huntsville.

#### Sign-In Mode
1. events - the name & place & duriation of the event
2. occurance - an instance of an event on a specific date
3. attendees - a partacipant of an event that shows up
2. participants - a saved list of people who have showed up to events.


on first sign in, a participant will be asked for a mininum set of information (with the ablility to make it private) such as Name, email (maybe more, but that's probably enough for a first pass). also set a PIN or password (something quick to type in so sign-in doesn't take a long time)

after first sign-in and on each additional sign in, ask for email address and PIN, maybe we can also get some additional information for that occurance, like (for hack night) able to help/busy/orginizer/whatever), they can also chose not to be displayed if they don't want to.



#### Display Mode
When a users signs in to an event occurance, they can be displayed in display mode. on a sign in, it will display a welcome message with the user and some of their info. (they can opt-out of this)

in between sign-in's it will cycle between other people who are signed in to the event occurance.
